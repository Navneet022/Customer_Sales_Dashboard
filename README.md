ðŸ’¡INSIGHTS:-
1. Fix the money-losing products first - Machines, Tables, and Supplies are bleeding cash. Either raise prices, find cheaper suppliers, or just stop selling them. No point in high sales if you're losing money on every transaction.
2. Double down on what's working - Copiers have great margins but low volume. Figure out why they're so profitable and apply that formula to other products. Maybe push this category harder in marketing.
3. January is killing us every year - Plan better for Q1. We should consider running post-holiday sales, clearance events, or introducing products that sell well in winter, rather than just accepting it's a bad month.
4. Don't focus just on one product to drive most of the  revenue - Phones drive most sales, but we need backup plans. Grow the middle performers like Chairs and Binders that are making money.
5. Focus on the profit margins - Sales went up 20% but profit only 12%. That's a red flag. Set minimum profit margins for each product and stick to them.
6. Figure out what made Q4 so good - November and December were strong. Was it holiday demand? Special promotions? Whatever it was, do more of that throughout the year.
8. Get operations under control - The Profit chart shows that the profits are too wild. Better inventory management and cost controls will make things more predictable and profitable.
